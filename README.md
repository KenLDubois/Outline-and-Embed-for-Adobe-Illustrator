# Outline-and-Embed-for-Adobe-Illustrator
Duplicates all text boxes, outlines copies and turns off visibility of original. Also embeds all images to simplify file hand-off.

Ever had an Illustrator file that you needed to send to a printer, but you don't want to slog through the million text boxes that need to be outline or the tons of images that need to be embedded? 

Well now you don't have to! And don't worry - if you have to go back and make changes to any of the text, this file will keep a copy of the original editable text box with its visibility turned off just below the outlined version it creates, so no fear of having to retype things! 

To have this appear in your 'Scripts' menu in Illustrator, simply place it in the following directory:
C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Illustrator CC 2015\Presets\en_US\Scripts\~

Enjoy!
